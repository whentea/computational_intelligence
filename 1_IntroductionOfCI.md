## Introduction  
CI is a branch of AI. In principle, CI consists of any science-supported approaches and technologies for analyzing, creating and developing intelligent system. Unlike AI that depends upon the knowledge derived from human expertise, however, CI mostly relies on the collection of numerical data and a set of nature-inspired computational paradigms. {1, 2}  
The major subject of CI is the study of unorthodox optimization technique.  
The aims are to utilize a finite commodity to archieve certain goals or objectives and to produce the maximum acceptability considering the initial goal (objective function).  
Traditionally, optimization problem were solved either using 3 ways like following diagram:
