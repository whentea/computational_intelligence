# Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Optimization  
  

>>Nature has inspired many researchers in many ways and thus is a rich source of inspiration.  
>>This clearly shows that classifications depend on the actual persepctive and motivations.  
>>This paper will focus on the source of inspiration when developing algorithms.
