>>Nature has evolved over billions of years, providing a rich source of inspiration {2, Preface}  

>>The core principle of all CI-based optimization algorithms, which are better known as metaheuristic algorithms, is a way of trial and error to produce an acceptable solution to a complex problem in a reasonably practical time (Yang 2010) {1, Page 3}
