* Algorithm  
>>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure of providing calculations and instructions. {2, Page 1}.  
>>Many algorithms are iterative (for constructing algorithms)  
>>The actual steps and procedures depend on the algorithm used and the context of interest  

* Newton's Method  
- Newton-Rapson Method  
* Optimization  
- Gradient-Based ALgorithm
